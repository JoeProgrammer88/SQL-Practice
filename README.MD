# SQL Server Practice Problems

This repository will have extra practice problems for students looking to reinforce their SQL skills
with other databases. A few Microsoft sample databases will be used, and long-term various other
3rd party databases will have questions created.

## Difficulty Levels

I would like to create beginner and intermediate level practice sets that would be appropriate for
students who have taken up to two college level SQL courses.

## Feedback

Students can submit feedback through GitHub as issues, send an email to my work email,
or message me on Discord.
